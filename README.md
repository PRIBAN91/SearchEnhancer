# SearchEnhancer
###Targeted at providing a fast, efficient and effective searching experience to a user.

In an era of fast paced world, we want machines to understand us better than we understand ourselves.We
want to spend minimum time spent transferring information to machines before they can take over.We want
human and machine interaction to be as meaningful and effective as possible. In a nutshell, we want machines
to understand us better than we understand ourselves. Maybe that is why Artificial Intelligence
even exist in this world.

This application is an unified Search API targeted for Ecommerce portals and other catalogue based websites.
It is based on the Linguistic and Natural Language Processing model.  Java is the programming language used
and is built on J2EE architecture. A web server (such as Apache Tomcat 8.0 or above) is needed to execute
this application. A simple table with the list of products will serve as an initial corpus. From there on it 
captures user's request and response and displays products/items according to popularity. This API has been
stress tested to a maximum of 4 million records with 16 to 40 characters each.

There are two URLs that can be consumed and both of them returns JSON array data. So, it can easily be consumed
by Web Portals, Android application, IOS application and Windows Phone application without breaking a sweat.
Few assumptions were made during building this application. This Search Enhancer will grow more effective with
time as machine learning is in place. 

It is still a work-in-progress. There are quite a lot things to be done yet. Error handling and comments are not proper yet. 
I will update the ReadMe as well with more details in the near future. For more details on installation and which URLs to consume when, please refer to the Wiki.
